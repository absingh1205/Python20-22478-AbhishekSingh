                <p>Old Trafford first opened its turnstiles on 19th February, 1910. The new stadium was commissioned after Manchester United’s new chairman decided that their existing modest grounds on Bank Street weren’t suitable for a team that had recently won both the First Division and FA Cup.

                    Scottish architect Archibald Leitch was brought on board to design Old Trafford. One of Britain’s top football designers, between 1899 and 1939 he was responsible for more than 20 stadiums, including Stamford Bridge, Arsenal and Celtic.
